# HelloAR
Starter app for understanding the basics of ARCore

# Software Versions
Android Studio: 3.5
Sceneform: 1.15.0

Reason for using these versions in 2020:
Android Studio 3.6.3 (released in April 2020) is buggy when made to work with Sceneform SDK 1.16.0 (latest version at the time of writing this).

Android Studio v3.5 is compatible with Sceneform v1.15.0
